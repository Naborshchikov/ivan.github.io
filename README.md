<h2> <p> Python 3 program for segmentation of protons and neutrons by physical properties to build models of atoms and molecules using hydrogen and helium as an example. Ver. 6.2 </p>
Description: </h2>
<p> Program identified two types of protons, neutrons and to single out three segments in each of them for electric charge, mass, volume. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The program uses publicly available data that is contained on the NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) website. Sometimes validated scientific data from open sources were used in addition to NIST data. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <h3> Key outcomes of the program and related conclusions: </h3> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Program contains mathematical conversion of a neutron to a proton. </p>
               <p>2. A proton and a neutron move along the time axis; a proton 2 and a neutron 2 move in the opposite direction. This is contributing to the formation of atoms, molecules and contributes to their destruction. </p>
               <p>3. Protons, neutrons consist of three segments located in the future, present, and past (confirmation of that: scientists have confirmed that the proton and neutron have a passage to another dimension (source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11182-019-01709-9). It is explaining the reason for the decay of the neutron, the stability of the proton.  </p>
               <p>4. Produced two types of neutrons with different characteristics. This explains why the "bottle" and "beam" methods for estimating the neutron lifetime give scientists different results. </p>
              <p>5. The presence of “complex” dipoles (has been confirmed by a large group of scientists experimentally (source: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4967465) that protons, neutrons have the form of a dipole). </p>
               <p> 6. Reveal an ultra-small particle - presumably a tachyon. </p>
                 <p>7. The presence of five different types of helium 3 atoms. </p>
                 <p> 8. There are 8 hydrogen molecules with different characteristics, two different helium atoms 2. </p>
                 <p>9. One common overlap in proton/neutron shells leads to the formation of a molecular bond, while two common overlaps in proton/neutron shells lead to the formation of an atom nucleus. </p>
                 <p>10. The "binding energy" in the nucleus of an atom is determined by the difference in masses between the two kinds of neutrons. </p>
                <p>11. The type of neutron involved in the formation, decay of the nucleus of an atom, molecule determines the type of reaction; the reaction proceeds with the release or absorption of heat.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <h3> Possibilities: </h3>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> - It can be used in reducing energy costs for modifying a substance, eliminating or reducing neutron radiation. </p>
<p> - Approach in Item 2, 9, 11 can be extrapolated to modelling materials by calculating their service life in advance, which will improve the durability and quality of the developed materials </p>
<p> -	Information from Item 6 can be used to develop computer models that analyse the processes occurring between quarks, aging and rejuvenation, and the possibility of temporal transitions </p>
<p> - For Item 7 can be developed computer programs for these technologies. </p>
<p> -	The obtained results will allow to reduce the temperature required for thermonuclear fusion hundreds of times, achieve a neutron-free reaction, developing an individual environmentally-friendly electric fusion generator for vehicles, buildings. </p>
<p> - The presented knowledge makes it possible to simplify the technological process of creating molecules in pharmaceuticals and chemistry; more efficient use of hydrogen bonds. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Characteristics of an ultra-small particle (item 6): </p>
<p> Electric charge: 9.027796614315168e-36 C </p>
<p> Mass: 5.1328712618966e-47 kg </p>
<p> Volume: 2.9503259453108798e-80 m.cube </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <h3> Obtained results: </h3>  </p>
<p> - Allows better understand the diversity of hydrogen bonds, intra- and intermolecular interactions, the physical properties of water and many organic liquids (alcohols, carboxylic acids, amides of carboxylic acids, esters). </p>
<p> - Makes possible to solve one of the important problems of modern chemistry - the creation of an efficient and safe hydrogen storage system, to develop a system that combines a high hydrogen storage density with low costs for its release. </p>
<p> - Allows better understand properties of biologically important substances such as proteins and nucleic acids (in particular, elements of the secondary structure (for example, α-helices, β-folds) and tertiary structure in protein, RNA and DNA molecules are stabilized by hydrogen bonds. In these macromolecules, hydrogen bonds hold parts of the same macromolecule together, causing it to fold into a particular shape) </p>
<p> More efficient computer models can be developed for each of stated above. </p>
<p>  - To assert that the calculated He2_1 will decay into two protons, and He2_2 will give deuterium upon decay. Clearly seen from the obtained structures and their characteristics. Detailed script can be executed additionally. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <h3> Key idea is that: </h3>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The laws of nature obey mathematical laws. Therefore, they can be digitized and represented in the form of computer code. The more correct the algorithm is chosen for the computer code, the smaller the difference between the calculated data and the well-known experimental data used will be, which is typical for the proposed software code. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <h3> Other related information: </h3>  </p>
<p> The error of the data obtained using the program version 6.2 tends to zero in comparison with the publicly available experimental data. For example, if we compare the data on quarks "u", we get an error equal to zero. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> For example, the value of the electric charge for quarks “u” and “u2” according to the program is:
</p>
<p> 1.0681177559999997e-19 C (Tuxq02 from class Algorithm()) </p>
<p> 1.068117756e-19 C (Tuxq13 from class Algorithm()) </p>

<p> Combinatorics, matrix calculus, cycles, logical calculus are important parts of the program code. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Two scripts are attached for visualization:  </p>
<p> - Distribution of a hydrogen molecule by segments in (%). </p>
<p> - Distribution of a He2_1 by segments in (%). </p>
<p> </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: for scientific analysis, use data from program version 6.2 please. For example, He2_2_Past_1_e and He2_2_Past_2_e are two different segments.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <h3> Project implemented in python ver. 3, with using anaconda 2020 02. </h3> <br>
To implement the project used: <br>
The libraries: numpy; scipy; prettytable; collections. For the attached separately scripts you will need: matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib, math <br>  </p>
<p><h3> The program includes 8 classes (the three classes are hosted independently), table with the original data placed separately: </h3> </p>
<p> The program code contains detailed comments and explanations. </p>
<p> <h4> Table with the original data </h4> Table#1. The table contains the data recommended by the US NIST and data of various groups of scientists. The table is made in the form of a separate script. </p>
<p> <h4> 1. class Algorithm () </h4>   - The 'class Algorithm()' class is used to calculate nuclei, shells of quarks 'u', 'd', and contains the data of constants used in the program. </p>
<p> <h4> 2. class Particles () </h4>   - This class forms the date set for protons, neutrons, calculates the characteristics of the tachyon. </p>
<p> <h4> 3. class Segments() </h4> - This class defines segments of protons, neutrons conditionally located in the past, present and future time. The values that can be obtained from this class are very simple and do not require additional comments. </p>
<p> For example: PROTON_Present_Q means it's a proton, the segment is present, and Q is the electric charge for this segment. The value of M at the end will talk about the mass. The V value at the end will indicate volume. The “matrix” value at the end will indicate the content of the matrix of values for the shells for the specified segment.  </p>
<p> <h4> 4. class Molecularhydrogen() </h4> - This class calculates the electric charge, mass, volume of eight different hydrogen molecules segment by segment. </p>
<p> Consider the notation using the MolecularH2_1_Past_1e as an example: </p>
<p> MolecularH2 - hydrogen molecule H2 </p>
<p> 1 - hydrogen molecule of the first type </p>
<p> Past - segment Past </p>
<p> 1 - first layer </p>
<p> e - the presence of an electron is taken into account </p>
<p> The absence of “e” at the end of the symbol means the absence of an electron. </p>
<p> <h4> 5. class He() </h4> - This class calculates the electric charge, mass, volume of two helium atoms 2 by segments; the presence of five helium atoms 3 and characteristics of common areas for protons, neutrons. The calculation was made taking into account each shell. The “intersection” extension denotes that the value refers to a common area of particles. </p>
<p>  He2_2_Present_4e means that this is helium 2, the second kind of atom, the fourth part of the segment is “present”, the data on the electron are taken into account. </p>
<p> <h4> 6. class Deltam() </h4> - This class explains "bond energy". It is taken from two types of neutrons having different weights. This class also introduces: </p>
<p> NEUTRON_Delta is used for exothermic reactions </p>
<p> NEUTRON_Delta2 is used in endothermic reactions </p>
<p> The nucleus of an atom, a molecule has binding energies, the formation of which or their destruction leads to the release of energy or its absorption. Chemical and nuclear reactions are like a handshake. For molecules, this is a "handshake with one hand", for particles in the nucleus, this is a "handshake with two hands". The destruction or formation of these bonds and causes heat or cold. The transition from "handshake with two hands" to "handshake with one hand" is the transition from nuclear to chemical bonding. </p>
<p> <h4> 7. class He3() </h4> - This class contains information about five helium 3 atoms. </p>
<p> Atom 0 has the following two merging regions: He3_0_Past_1_e; He3_0_Present_0_e  </p>
<p> Electrons are placed on the last shell for the following areas: He3_0_Present_1_e; He3_0_Present_3_e </p>

<p> Atom 1 has the following two merging regions: He3_1_Past_1_e; He3_1_Present_0_e </p>
<p> Electrons are placed on the last shell for the following areas: He3_1_Present_1_e; He3_1_Present_2_e </p>

<p> Atom 2 has the following two merging regions: He3_2_Present_0_e; He3_2_Future_0_e </p>
<p> Electrons are placed on the last shell for the following areas: He3_2_Present_1_e; He3_2_Present_2_e </p>

<p> Atom 3 has the following two merging regions: He3_3_Present_0_e; He3_3_Future_0_e </p>
<p> Electrons are placed on the last shell for the following areas:  He3_3_Present_1_e; He3_3_Present_3_e</p>

<p> Atom 4 has the following two merging regions: He3_4_Past_1_e; He3_4_Present_0_e </p>
<p> Electrons are placed on the last shell for the following areas: He3_4_Present_1_e; e3_4_Present_2_e  </p>
<p> The basic placement of the electrons is shown. </p>
<p> All values are presented in the SI system: the first column is the charge in Coulomb, the second column is the mass in kilograms, the third column is the volume in cubic meters. </p>
<p> From all five variants of He3 atoms, only the first variant of the atom in each bond contains a He2 joint. The remaining 4 variants of the He3 atom contain the He2 joint in only one bond. Therefore, the synthesis of the first variant of the He3 atom from hydrogen molecules will require significantly less energy than the synthesis of the remaining 4 variants of He3 atoms.  </p>
<p> Thus, it can be argued that there is an energy-efficient method of thermonuclear fusion. </p>

<p> <h4> 8. class He2_properties () </h4> - Div-E has been calculated according to the first Maxwell equation for each segment, the shell of helium2 atoms.  </p>
<p> The decay time of the first helium2 core into two protons in vacuum was calculated: </p>
<p> unit06.T17 - 2.407125427875271e-21 c </p>
<p> It is calculated that the decomposition reaction proceeds in three phases. </p>
<p> The first phase is the time to break the first intranuclear bond: </p>
<p> unit06.T16 - 1.569159784690606e-21с </p>
<p>The second phase is the state of the ion of the hydrogen molecule: </p>
<p> unit06.T18 - 8.37965643184665e-22 с </p>
<p> The third phase is the breaking of the second intranuclear connection. </p>
 <p> At the moment after the breaking of intranuclear bonds in helium2, protons will look like flat disks. This effect is achieved due to ultra-high accelerations when intranuclear bonds are broken in helium2 in vacuum, that is, the speed of protons after breaking intranuclear bonds approaches the speed of light. </p>
