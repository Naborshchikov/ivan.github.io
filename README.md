<h2> <p> The relationship of matter. </p>
Description: </h2>
<p> The Project has implemented an algorithm for the relationship of matter, presented the physical-mathematical model. The Project allows: </p>
<p> The main branch is currently being used to confirm the priority. </p>
<p> Creating new technological processes, optimizing existing technologies. </p>

<p> Receiving exotic materials such as metallic hydrogen: metallic hydrogen as fuel; metallic hydrogen as an ultralight, ultra-strong, heat-resistant, radiation-resistant material.   </p>

<p> To begin the development of new medical equipment based on non-contact point destruction of harmful bacteria, viruses, and mutated cells in the human body. </p>

<p> To obtain a powerful, environmentally friendly, lightweight electric thermal generator, which will provide electricity to individual buildings and vehicles for decades. </p>

<p> Consider in comparison graphs 23, 24, 25. We will see in graph 25 that the simultaneous use of electromagnetic, gravitational fields and frequency, regardless of speed, will produce maximum and minimum values. This effect will make it possible to obtain exotic materials and required technological parameters with minimal energy consumption. </p>

<p> <h3> Project implemented in python ver. 3.7.6, with using anaconda 2020 02. </h3> <br>
To implement the project used: <br>
1. The libraries: pandas; numpy; matplotlib; scipy; prettytable; collections; plotly. <br>
2. The data: Nobel laureates; constants recommended by NIST USA (Table#1). <br>
3. The author's algorithm. </p>

<p><h3> The program includes 11 classes: </h3> </p>
<p> <h4> “class Algorithm():” </h4>  - This class contains an algorithm for calculating a physical-mathematical model with a detailed explanation. </p>

<p> <h4> “class Wave():”, “class Electromagnetism():”, “class Gravity():”, “class Frequency():” </h4>   - These classes calculate the characteristics of fundamental interactions in quarks. </p>
<p> “class Particles():” This class calculates the electric charge, mass, volume by shells in a proton, neutron, and their twins. Project with this class divide protons, neutrons from their twins. The smallest particle, the carrier of an electric charge, is also defined in this class. <br>
ATTENTION! A "while" loop without interruption is used to find this particle.  </p>
<p> <h4> “class Wavep():”, “class Electromagnetismp():”, “class Gravityp():”, “class Frequencyp():” </h4>   These classes calculate fundamental interactions in shells in a proton, neutron, and their twins. <br> </p>
<p> <h4> “class Practice():”</h4> This class defines the relationship of frequency, wavelength for a proton, neutron, their twins at a speed in the range from minus to plus the speed of light.  </p>
<p> The project prints out seven tables. Table one contains the initial data, the rest of the tables include essential data obtained during the implementation of the Project. The project prints out some demo graphs. </p>
<h2> Installation: </h2>
<p> The project does not require any special skills to install. It will work on Jupiter Notebook. If you are missing some packages, then they are easily loaded using pip. </p>
<h2> Usage:  </h2>
<p> To start the Project, it is enough to use Run. Everything will be done automatically. The program contains all the necessary comments.  </p>
<p> The project allows developing new industrial technologies, including obtaining exotic materials, assessing the impact of fields on the human condition, and obtaining new environmentally friendly energy sources. </p>
<p> It is possible to obtain exotic materials with the following characteristics: </p>

<p> Radiation resistant from neutrons pcs/m3, respectively ≥ 1.5978313081543083*e48. Note, that the decay of one ton of uranium 92U235 will produce 6.12*e27 (approximately) neutrons. Thus, one cubic meter of material will absorb neutrons from the decay 6.6*e20 tons of uranium 92U235. </p>

<p> Temperature resistant from photons, 0C, respectively  ≤ 81*e18. Note, that the temperature at the center of a nuclear explosion at 0C is e7 (approximately), that is, the material of the EMH absorbs heat from e11 nuclear explosions, and the protective field will withstand temperatures exceeding the temperature at the center of a nuclear explosion 81*e11 times.  </p>
<p> Knowledge of the structure of the proton, the cyclicity of its phases, the relationship of fundamental forces, mass, charge, the volume allows the use of their mutual reinforcement in the production of metallic hydrogen. Imagine a "positive resonance" that, with a little external stimulus, produces a significant positive effect. </p>
<p> In terms of use for the development of new equipment for human treatment. Each person hears a lot of what he considers to be noise. A similar thing happens in the human body, each particle has its own characteristics and causes noise characteristic only for it. But just as each person recognizes another by their voice, so the equipment recognizes a particle, bacterium, molecule by its characteristics. To do this, the device needs to know its characteristics. The computer into which the proposed physical-mathematical model is loaded will calculate such characteristics. </p>
<p> Today, the location of any smartphone user can be found. The device will be able to find a particle, bacterium, virus in the human body in the same way. The knowledge obtained with the help of a physical-mathematical model, which, on the one hand, allows creating atoms, particles with minimal energy costs, will, on the other hand, also destroy viruses and bacteria harmful to the body. </p>
<p> Thus, any person will be able to recover from a large number of diseases in a hospital in a short time and return to the family full of strength and health. </p>
<p> The project allows the development of a new generation thermoelectric generator. It will work for tens of years, providing electricity to a house, car, plane, and spacecraft. It will be eco-friendly, safe. </p>
<p> The project allows the production of an ultra-light, ultra-strong material from hydrogen. Density: 287.5 kg/m. cube. The number of atoms/ions in the lattice 3/1. Heat resistance 2.3xe25 J/kg.  </p>
<p> Only part of the Project is posted on the site in the form of program code due to the specifics of its capabilities. </p>
