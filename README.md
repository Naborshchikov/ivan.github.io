<h2>Description:<br></h2>

<p>The author's algorithm has been developed. The algorithm is implemented in python ver. 3.7.6, with using anaconda 2020 02. <br>
The program includes 23 classes, logic, loops, arrays, visualization. </p>

<p>The algorithm made it possible to identify twins for quarks “u” and “d”, neutron and proton, to calculate characteristics for them. 
Theoretically, a particle was obtained with an electric charge less than the electric charge of an electron by 60 times.  <br>
Was calculated, explained, visualized the relationship between fundamental interactions, mass, charge, volume.  </p>

<p>The initial data are presented in Table 1. They consist of data obtained by Nobel laureates, and data recommended by the US NIST.</p> 

<p>The conclusions are in table 12. They contain comments on the obtained graphs, tables, results; expand the understanding of the world of particles, regularity.</p>

<p>These results simplify the control of reactions, enable users to receive cumulative benefits, reduce energy and time costs; receive new materials. </p>

<h2>Installation:  <br></h2>

<p>The project does not require any special skills to install. It will work on Jupiter Notebook. If you are missing some packages, then they are easily loaded using pip. </p>

<h2>Usage:  <br></h2>

<p>To start the Project, it is enough to use Run. Everything will be done automatically. The program contains all the necessary comments.  <br>
Therefore, if you need to use the received data in another program, you can easily find a place to insert the script.  <br>
If you need to calculate, other elementary particles that are absent in the program, please contact the author. </p>
