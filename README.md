Description: 

The author's algorithm has been developed. The algorithm is implemented in python ver. 3.7.6, with using anaconda 2020 02. The program includes 23 classes, logic, loops, arrays, visualization.

The algorithm made it possible to identify twins for quarks “u” and “d”, neutron and proton, to calculate characteristics for them. Theoretically, a particle was obtained with an electric charge less than the electric charge of an electron by 60 times. Was calculated, explained, visualized the relationship between fundamental interactions, mass, charge, volume. 

The initial data are presented in Table 1. They consist of data obtained by Nobel laureates, and data recommended by the US NIST. 

The conclusions are in table 12. They contain comments on the obtained graphs, tables, results; expand the understanding of the world of particles, regularity.

These results simplify the control of reactions, enable users to receive cumulative benefits, reduce energy and time costs; receive new materials.

Installation: 

The project does not require any special skills to install. It will work on Jupiter Notebook. If you are missing some packages, then they are easily loaded using pip.

Usage: 

To start the Project, it is enough to use Run. Everything will be done automatically. The program contains all the necessary comments. Therefore, if you need to use the received data in another program, you can easily find a place to insert the script. If you need to calculate, other elementary particles that are absent in the program, please contact the author.
