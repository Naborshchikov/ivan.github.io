Project name: Ver. 3.1. Unification of fundamental interactions by the example of a proton, a neutron.

Description: The author's approach has been developed. It allowed writing the presented program in python, which in a couple of minutes on a laptop Lenovo (Intel(R) Core™ i7-3630QM CPU @ 2.40 GHz) calculates, visualizes data on 9 shells of a proton, neutron, pseudo neutron, virtual pseudo proton. Visualization made it possible to reveal the analytical relationship between charge, mass, volumes inside the particles, between the four fundamental interactions.

As the initial data for the program, data were selected experimentally obtained by Nobel laureates, and several recent published achievements of various scientists, as well as the generally accepted constants. The known data on quarks “u”, “d”, proton, neutron were used. All initial data and most data obtained by the program are displayed in the form of separate tables. 

The program uses common python attributes, including opportunities plot.ly.

The project made it possible to reveal that the relationship between charge, mass, the volume inside particles as well as any three fundamental interactions is described by several analytical 3D segments on straight lines, which are interconnected in triangles. For a proton, a neutron, it is two connected to each other on one side of the triangle. For a pseudo neutron, a virtual pseudo proton, these are three such triangles. This is clearly visualized in the graphs: “Interrelation of mass, volume, and charge within a neutron Ver 3.1”; “Interrelation of mass, volume, charge within a proton Ver 3.1”; “Interrelation of mass, volume, charge within a psproton Ver 2.0”; “Interrelation of mass, volume, charge within a psneutron Ver 3.1”, and on graphs for fundamental interactions. 
In general, the equation for the first line segment will be as follows:
(m – mn)/(mn+1 – mn) = (q – qn)/(qn+1 – qn) = (v – vn)/(vn+1 – vn)
m ∈ [mn, mn+1]  q ∈ [qn, qn+1]  v ∈ [vn, vn+1]  
Where: 
m – mass; q – charge; v – volume

The project simplified the understanding of the structure of the proton, neutron; predicted the presence of a new particle - a pseudo neutron. This knowledge simplifies the control of thermonuclear reactions, enable users to gain cumulative benefits from optimal concurrent use of fundamental interactions.

The project allows me to assert that the four fundamental interactions represent the pyramid, and the resulting spatial triangles are its projections. 

Installation: To implement the Project, a third version of python is required. The project does not require any special skills to install. It will work on Jupiter Notebook. If you are missing some packages, then they are easily loaded using pip. 

Usage: To start the Project, it is enough to use Run. Everything will be done automatically. The program contains all the necessary comments. Therefore, if you need to use the received data in another program, you can easily find a place to insert the script. If you need to calculate, other elementary particles that are absent in the program, please contact the author.

To use interactive features, after running the program, click on “Export to plot.ly” after the first and second graphs. Two new windows will open. Next, use the documentation to work with plot.ly, build, and analyze the dependencies of interest from the data obtained by the program.
