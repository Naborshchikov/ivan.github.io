<h2> <p> Space-temporal structure of protons and neutrons to obtain new electric current source, materials and understanding freedom of choice in the program code on a python 3. </p>
Description: </h2>
<p> The algorithm at Python3 for demonstrations of the space-time structure of matter by the example of protons, neutrons, and computed tachyons. The algorithm starts from two digits. The first number is "2" - two different quarks. The second number is "3" - three quarks totally. </p>
<p> Combinatorics, matrix calculus, cycles, logical calculus are important parts of the program code. Most of the data used for the calculation is taken from the official site of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). </p>
<p> The laws of nature obey mathematical laws. Therefore, they can be digitized and represented in the form of computer code. </p>
<p> The presented program contains a pair of values for the “u” and “d” quarks obtained by calculation for the analysis of a proton, a neutron. In total, there are nine different mathematical variations on the formation of a proton, a neutron. The more correct the algorithm is chosen for the computer code, the smaller the error will be. Calculated values of the charge in quarks according to the program are presented in table 2 </p>
<p> That is, the error of the calculated data obtained using the program from the experimental data:  </p>
<p> “u” – 0%; “u2” – 0% </p>
<p> “d” – 8.326672684688674e-15%; “d” – -8.326672684688674e-15% </p>

<p> The program (class Algorithm) contains the mathematical conversion of a neutron to a proton. </p>
<p> S = np.hsplit(N1, 2) </p>
<p> P1 = np.concatenate((S[1], S[0]), axis=1) </p>
<p> S1 = np.hsplit(N2, 2) </p>
<p> P2 = np.concatenate((S1[1], S1[0]), axis=1) </p>
<p> S3 = np.hsplit(N3, 2) </p>
<p> P3 = np.concatenate((S3[1], S3[0]), axis=1) </p>
<p>This information is possible to use for calculating energy consumption at modifying matter. </p>
<p>The program has its own boundaries. The singular matrices (class Algorithm) thus obtained have not been analyzed </p>
<p>try: </p>   
    <p>xq13 = linalg.solve(Q3, bq) </p>
    <p>xq16 = linalg.solve(Q6, bq) </p>
   <p> xq17 = linalg.solve(Q7, bq) </p>
   <p> xq18 = linalg.solve(Q8, bq) </p>
    <p>print('') </p>
    <p>B13 = np.linalg.inv(xq13) </p>
    <p>B16 = np.linalg.inv(xq16) </p>
    <p>B17 = np.linalg.inv(xq17) </p>
    <p>B18 = np.linalg.inv(xq18) </p>
<p>except: </p>
<p> The computed structures protons and neutrons indicate that: a proton and a neutron move along the time axis and have a clockwise spin; a proton 2 and a neutron 2 move in the opposite direction and have counterclockwise spin. </p>
<p> Protons, neutrons consist of three segments located in the future, present, and past time. As proof of this, one can take the fact that scientists have confirmed that the proton and neutron have a passage to another dimension: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11182-019-01709-9 </p>
<p>    Knowledge of the features of segments of protons, neutrons allow: </p>
<p> Firstly. Present the space-time structure of protons, neutrons. This data can be obtained from the presented program code. </p>
<p> Secondly. Gives knowledge about possible combinations of interactions of protons, neutrons. This can be done by adding a small script to the program code. </p>
<p> Thirdly. Allows us to calculate characteristics for the interaction of protons, neutrons, and the formation of particle nuclei. </p>

<p> Energy and mass transfer of a neutron between its segments located at different times leads to decay. At the same time, this indicates the possibility of travel in time.   </p>
<p> The presented segmentation by the time of the proton and the neutron explains the reason for the decay of the neutron, the stability of the proton. This approach can be extrapolated to modeling materials by calculating their service life in advance, which will improve the durability and quality of the developed materials. </p>
<p> The project has produced two types of neutrons with different characteristics. This explains why the "bottle" and "beam" methods for estimating the neutron lifetime give scientists different results. This can be viewed as proof of the obtained results. </p>
<p> Protons, neutrons have the form of a dipole. This has been  confirmed by a large group of scientists experimentally: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4967465 The project contains a theoretical basis for this phenomenon. </p>
<p> The obtained results for protons will reduce the temperature required for thermonuclear fusion hundreds of times, achieve a neutron-free reaction. This opens up the possibility of developing an individual environmentally-friendly electric fusion generator for vehicles, buildings. </p>
<p> The particle called a tachyon is calculated. A tachyon moves between parts of a proton, a neutron, located at different times. It is involved in the reactions of the energy and mass exchange inside the proton, the neutron. The presence of a tachyon suggests the presence of an antitachyon, which in turn will allow beginning the study of rejuvenation. </p>
<p> <h3> Project implemented in python ver. 3.7.6, with using anaconda 2020 02. </h3> </p>
<p> To implement the project used: </p>
<p> The libraries: pandas; numpy; matplotlib; scipy; prettytable; collections; csv. <br>  </p>
<p><h3> The program includes 3 classes, table with the original data, and analytics section: </h3> </p>
<p> <h4> 1. Table with the original data </h4>  - Table#1. The table contains the data recommended by the US NIST and data of various groups of scientists. </p>
<p> <h4> 2. class Algorithm() </h4>   - This is the heart of the program developed by the author. Combinatorics, matrix calculus is used in this class. The logic in this class allows a specialist to modify it to a convolutional neural network and use it for all types of particles. The class has undergone significant improvements. This class is partially adapted for the calculation of any particles. </p>
<p> <h4> 3. class Particles () </h4>   - This class forms the date set for protons, neutrons, calculates the characteristics of the tachyon. ATTENTION:  The tachyon is calculated at while loop, loop break is absent. </p>
<p> <h4> 4. class Tachion () </h4> - The class calculates the relationship of tachyons with time segments of the neutron, proton. The class makes it possible to construct accurate energy balance equations. </p>
<p> The program contains a detailed calculation of each time segment of the proton, neutron. Logical operators, loops, NumPy are used for these purposes. </p>

<p> <h4> 4. Analytics section </h4>   - The analytical section visualizes the conclusions presented in the description. </p>
<p> The histograms (Graphs 1-3) show the distribution of volume, electric charge, and mass over the shells of protons and neutrons. </p>
<p> Graphs from 4 to 15, showing the distribution by volume, electrical charge, and mass, and it will simplify the technology of thermonuclear fusion. </p>
<p> Graphs from 16 to 27 show the distribution of volume, electric charge, the mass of protons, neutrons in the future, present, and past time. </p>
<p> Graph 28 shows the relative position of the tachyon, electron, protons, and neutrons, depending on the mass and electric charge. </p>
<p> Graph 29 shows the distribution electric charge for neutron for segment at present`s time. </p> 
<p> Graphs 30, 31, 30b, 31b, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 show the completeness of the past, the certainty of the future, the presence of several options in the present for each stream of time. The existence in the present tense of several versions for interconnection characteristics in protons, neutrons suggests that the freedom of choice for a person is laid down at an elementary level, but it has its limits. </p>
<p>  Graphs from 32 to 35 show the difference between the pairs proton-neutron, proton 2 - neutron 2, and are used to justify movement along and against the time axis. Five hundred points generated in the interval of minimum and maximum between values allow you to emphasize this. </p>
<p>  Graphs 36 to 41 explain the decay of the neutron, the production of the proton. The segment of the neutron in the past is the singular matrix = [0. 0. 0.] under any conditions. The segment decreases for the proton in the past in comparison with the neutron. The segment increases for the proton in the future in comparison with the neutron. Thus, the decay of the neutron promotes the proton's advance into the future. </p>
