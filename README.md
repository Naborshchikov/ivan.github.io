<h2> <p> Space-temporal structure of protons and neutrons and their transformation to obtain new materials and travel in time. </p>
Description: </h2>
<p> The algorithm at Python3 for demonstrations of the space-time structure of matter by the example of protons, neutrons, and computed tachyons. </p>
<p>  Combinatorics, matrix calculus, cycles, logical calculus are important parts of the program code. </p>
<p> Most of the data used for the calculation is taken from the official site of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). </p>
<p> The computed structures protons and neutrons indicate that: a proton and a neutron move along the time axis and have a clockwise spin; a proton 2 and a neutron 2 move in the opposite direction and have counterclockwise spin. </p>
<p> Protons, neutrons consist of three segments located in the future, present, and past time. As proof of this, one can take the fact that scientists have confirmed that the proton and neutron have a passage to another dimension: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11182-019-01709-9 </p>
<p> Energy and mass transfer of a neutron between its segments located at different times leads to decay. At the same time, this indicates the possibility of travel in time.   </p>
<p>  The presented segmentation by the time of the proton and the neutron explains the reason for the decay of the neutron, the stability of the proton. This approach can be extrapolated to modeling materials by calculating their service life in advance, which will improve the durability and quality of the developed materials. </p>
<p> The project has produced two types of neutrons with different characteristics. This explains why the "bottle" and "beam" methods for estimating the neutron lifetime give scientists different results. This can be viewed as proof of the obtained results. </p>
<p> Protons, neutrons have the form of a dipole. This has been  confirmed by a large group of scientists experimentally: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4967465 The project contains a theoretical basis for this phenomenon. </p>
<p> The obtained results for protons will reduce the temperature required for thermonuclear fusion hundreds of times, achieve a neutron-free reaction. This opens up the possibility of developing an individual environmentally-friendly electric fusion generator for vehicles, buildings. </p>
<p> The particle called a tachyon is calculated. A tachyon moves between parts of a proton, a neutron, located at different times. It is involved in the reactions of the energy and mass exchange inside the proton, the neutron. The presence of a tachyon suggests the presence of an antitachyon, which in turn will allow beginning the study of rejuvenation. </p>
<p> <h3> Project implemented in python ver. 3.7.6, with using anaconda 2020 02. </h3> <br>
To implement the project used: <br>
The libraries: pandas; numpy; matplotlib; scipy; prettytable; collections; csv; warnings. <br>  </p>
<p><h3> The program includes 3 classes, table with the original data, and analytics section: </h3> </p>
<p> <h4> 1. Table with the original data </h4>  - Table#1. The table contains the data recommended by the US NIST and data of various groups of scientists. </p>
<p> <h4> 2. class Algorithm ()</h4>   - This is the heart of the program developed by the author. Combinatorics, matrix calculus is used in this class. The logic in this class allows a specialist to modify it to a convolutional neural network and use it for all types of particles. </p>
<p> <h4> 3. class Particles () </h4>   - This class forms the date set for protons, neutrons, calculates the characteristics of the tachyon. ATTENTION:  The tachyon is calculated at while loop, loop break is absent. </p>
<p> <h4> 4. class Tachion () </h4> - The class calculates the relationship of tachyons with time segments of the neutron, proton. The class makes it possible to construct accurate energy balance equations. </p>
<p> The program contains a detailed calculation of each time segment of the proton, neutron. Logical operators, loops, NumPy are used for these purposes. </p>

Table 5: Values of electric charge, mass, volume by shells for the neutron2. Table 6: Values of electric charge, mass, volume by shells for the neutron. Table 7: Mass, electric charge and volume of the tachyon. Table 8: The distribution of characteristics for neutron over time segments. Table 9: The distribution of characteristics for proton over time segments. Table 10: The distribution of characteristics for neutron 2 over time segments. Table 11: The distribution of characteristics for proton 2 over time segments. Table 12 : Comparison of the density and volumetric electric the density of protons and neutrons by time segments. </p>
<p> <h4> 4. Analytics section </h4>   - The analytical section visualizes the conclusions presented in the description. </p>
<p> The histograms (Graphs 1-3) show the distribution of volume, electric charge, and mass over the shells of protons and neutrons. </p>
<p> Graphs from 4 to 15, showing the distribution by volume, electrical charge, and mass, and it will simplify the technology of thermonuclear fusion. </p>
<p> Graphs from 16 to 27 show the distribution of volume, electric charge, the mass of protons, neutrons in the future, present, and past time. </p>
<p> Graph 28 shows the relative position of the tachyon, electron, protons, and neutrons, depending on the mass and electric charge. </p>
<p> Graphs from 29 to 31 show how the time segmentation simplifies the analysis of particle characteristics.  In addition, graphs 30, 31 allow you to evaluate the possibility of using spatial lines when generating points for further calculations. </p>
<p>  Graphs from 32 to 35 show the difference between the pairs proton-neutron, proton 2 - neutron 2, and are used to justify movement along and against the time axis. Five hundred points generated in the interval of minimum and maximum between values allow you to emphasize this. </p>
<p>  Graphs 36 to 41 explain the decay of the neutron, the production of the proton. The segment of the neutron in the past is the singular matrix = [0. 0. 0.] under any conditions. The segment decreases for the proton in the past in comparison with the neutron. The segment increases for the proton in the future in comparison with the neutron. Thus, the decay of the neutron promotes the proton's advance into the future. </p>
<h2> Installation: </h2>
<p> The project does not require any special skills to install. It will work on Jupiter Notebook. If you are missing some packages, then they are easily loaded using pip. </p>
<h2> Usage:  </h2>
<p> To start the Project, it is enough to use Run. Everything will be done automatically. The program contains all the necessary comments.  </p>
<p> Therefore, if you need to use the received data in another program, you can easily find a place to insert the script.  </p>
<p> The presented data will speed up the transition to thermonuclear energy, electric vehicles, electric planes, new durable, reliable materials, improve the ecological situation. </p>
<p> The presented results allow scientists to move on to a study of time travel and the extension of human life. </p>
